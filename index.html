                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm Shaun Messick, a passionate and driven software development student currently honing
                        my Python, JavaScript, and Java skills at Coding Dojo. With a keen interest in technology and a
                        constant thirst for learning, I am on a journey to become a versatile and proficient software
                        developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a twenty-year career in education, I embarked on my software development journey at Coding
                        Dojo, where I am learning programming languages and embracing the problem-solving mindset
                        crucial in tech. Here, I am exposed to diverse technologies and methodologies, which will be
                        instrumental in shaping my approach towards coding and software engineering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My current focus is Python, Delving into its versatile uses from web development to data
                        science. JavaScript: Exploring front-end technologies and understanding the intricacies of web
                        interactions. Java: Strengthening my understanding of object-oriented programming and backend
                        development. I am committed to continuous learning and improvement. I enjoy tackling programming
                        challenges, building projects, and collaborating with peers to broaden my knowledge and skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I progress in my journey, I am excited about the endless possibilities in the tech world. I
                        am open to internships, collaborative projects, and opportunities to contribute and further my
                        skills while being part of innovative solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I love to spend time with my family, espeically my cute granddaughter. I love
                        football and baseball and try to attend as many baseball games as I can. In July 2022, I finally
                        got to visit the historic Fenway park and watch my beloved Red Sox destroy the Yankees in two
                        games. I literally cried when I walked into that ballpark for the first time. I am also an
                        Arizona Diomandbacks fan since moving to Arizona from the frozen tundra of Idaho in 2023. I also
                        love to play golf and code whenever I get the chance.

                        and change careers. I have always been good with computers and a quick learner of technology. I
                        was always my family's IT guy. The logical step was to go into software development for my next
                        career.</p>
                    <p class="bootcamp-text">In December 2023, I began the Coding Dojo Software Development Bootcamp
                        Online Part-Time Accelerated Program. The program is designed for individuals seeking to
                        transition into the tech industry while balancing other job and family commitments. The program
                        offers a condensed, intensive learning experience that allows students to gain comprehensive
                        coding skills in a shorter time than traditional part-time programs.</p>
                    <p class="bootcamp-text">Overall, the Online Part-Time Accelerated Program is designed to help equip
                        me with the necessary skills to enter the tech field quickly, offering a fast-paced yet flexible
                        learning path suitable for a career change. The skills I learned from the Web Development course
                        enabled me to create this website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my portfolio</p>
